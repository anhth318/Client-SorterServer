# Client-SorterServer
The project describes the communication between a client and a server for sorting numbers
There are two running programs: Client and Server. 
The Client sends some numbers (separated by space character) to the Server. In his turn, the Server uses an interface called NumberSorter and it implemented it with different sort algorithms.
